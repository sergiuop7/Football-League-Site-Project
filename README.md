# Site-Project
Site made in HTML, PHP, CSS and MYSQL


The site created for the discipline "Databases" has as its theme the presentation of the first league of
English football. Details about teams, sponsors, matches played, coaches, etc. are presented. It also
contains a login page with distinct rights for admin and user. The application was mostly made in HTML
language, by programming directly in source code (writing command lines). The project was made using
the XAMPP application and the database was implemented in phpMyAdmin.
